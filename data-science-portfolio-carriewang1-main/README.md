# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021.

In the course of COMP2200, we were given three portfolios of data analysis problems which we are required to apply the statistical techniques that we have learnt during lectures into the form of Python. These portfolios includes one or more datasets. The description of each of the dataset will be showed below.

## Portfololio 1

The first dataset is an export from the lecturer - Steve Cassidy's represent four races of cycling dataset from Strava.The data has recorded four races of time traials and road races in 2016 and 2019 seperately, and it summerises the key variables of each of the bike perfomace,such as GPS location data and some measurements related to cycling performace like heart rate and power. The goal for us is to perform some exploration and analysis of this conduct exploratary data analysis (EDA) - which contains creating distribution graphs, boxplots, scatter plots and correlation matrix for the key variables on data visulasition.

## Portfolio 2

The second dataset is from the Federal Government Sport Vouchers program based on South Austrlalian LGA areas ,and the goal's for this portfolio is to finds some feathers that impacts vouchers used and also find differents or similar stuffs compared to Queensland LGA areas.This exercise practice my skills in exploring data ,such as data cleanning and communicating the insights that i can gain from data. 

## Portfolio 3

The last dataset i  was working on some (fake but realistic) data on Mobile Customer Churn, where is a customer leaves the mobile provider. The goal for this task is to build a simple predictive model to predict churn from available features.I was using Logistic  Regression and DecisionTree Regression to deal with predict the value of the CHURN_IND field in the data from some of the other fields,and at the same time i showed accurancy in each of the predict model to figured out which feathers can improve our accurcy scores when using them in prediction.
