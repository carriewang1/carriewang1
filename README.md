### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a Master of Interaction Design from The University of Queensland, where I studies Interaction Design . I also have a Bachelor of Business Analytics from Macquarie University, where I learned about Business/Commerce. My core competencies include Figma (Software), Data Analysis, and Analytical Skills, which I have applied in various projects and roles.

Most recently, I was a Unit Representative at Macquarie University, where I generated two unit feedback surveys to students, worked as a team, and assisted the unit convenor in two reports on improvements to students' learning experience. Before that, I was a Digital Marketing Analyst at AIESEC, where I designed digital posts, conducted marketing research, communicated with external stakeholders, and tracked and converted local participation in Salesforce. I am passionate about creating user-centric and data-driven solutions that enhance the digital experience and engagement of diverse audiences. I value collaboration, innovation, and social impact, and I can bring a unique perspective and skill set to any team or organization.
